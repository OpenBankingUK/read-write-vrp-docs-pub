## Overview

The Domestic VRPs resource is used by a TPP to initiate a domestic payment, under an authorised VRP Consent.

This resource description should be read in conjunction with a compatible Payment Initiation API Profile.

## Endpoints

| Resource |HTTP Operation |Endpoint |Mandatory |Scope |Grant Type |Message Signing |Idempotency Key |Request Object |Response Object |
| -------- |-------------- |-------- |----------- |----- |---------- |--------------- |--------------- |-------------- |--------------- |
| domestic-vrps |POST |POST /domestic-vrps | Conditional |vrp-consents:sweeping, vrp-consents:other |Authorization Code |Signed Request Signed Response |Yes | OBDomesticVRPRequest |OBDomesticVRPResponse |
| domestic-vrps |GET |GET /domestic-vrps/{DomesticVRPId} | Conditional |vrp-consents:sweeping, vrp-consents:other |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBDomesticVRPResponse |
| domestic-vrps |GET |GET /domestic-vrps/{DomesticVRPId}/payment-details | Optional |vrp-consents:sweeping, vrp-consents:other |Client Credentials |Signed Response |No |NA |OBDomesticVRPRequestDetailResponse |

### POST /domestic-vrps

Once a `domestic-vrp-consents` has been authorised by the PSU, the TPP can proceed to submitting a `domestic-vrps` for processing.

This is done by making a POST request to the `domestic-vrps` endpoint.

This request is an instruction to the ASPSP to begin the domestic single immediate payment journey. The domestic payment must be executed immediately, however, there are some scenarios where the domestic payment may not be executed immediately (e.g., busy periods at the ASPSP).

The TPP **must** ensure that the `Initiation` and `Risk` section matches the values specified in the consent.

If the `CreditorAccount` was not specified in the the consent, the `CreditorAccount` must be specified in the instruction.

The TPP **must** ensure that the end-point is called with the same scope as the one used for the corresponding consent.

#### Status

A `domestic-vrps` can only be created if its corresponding `domestic-vrp-consents` resource has the status of `Authorised`.

The `domestic-vrps` resource that is created successfully must have one of the following `PaymentStatusCode` values

- Pending
- Rejected
- AcceptedSettlementInProcess
- AcceptedSettlementCompleted
- AcceptedWithoutPosting
- AcceptedCreditSettlementCompleted

### GET /domestic-vrps/{DomesticVRPId}

Once the domestic vrp is created, a TPP can retrieve the `domestic-vrps` to check its status by using this endpoint.

The domestic-vrp resource must have one of the following PaymentStatusCode code-set enumerations:

- Pending
- Rejected
- AcceptedSettlementInProcess
- AcceptedSettlementCompleted
- AcceptedWithoutPosting
- AcceptedCreditSettlementCompleted

### GET /domestic-vrps/{DomesticVRPId}/payment-details

A TPP can retrieve the details of the underlying payment transaction via this endpoint. This resource allows ASPSPs to return a richer list of Payment Statuses, and if available payment scheme related statuses.

The API must return one of the following status codes:

- Accepted
- AcceptedCancellationRequest
- AcceptedTechnicalValidation
- AcceptedCustomerProfile
- AcceptedFundsChecked
- AcceptedWithChange
- Pending
- Rejected
- AcceptedSettlementInProcess
- AcceptedSettlementCompleted
- AcceptedWithoutPosting
- AcceptedCreditSettlementCompleted
- Cancelled
- NoCancellationProcess
- PartiallyAcceptedCancellationRequest
- PartiallyAcceptedTechnicalCorrect
- PaymentCancelled
- PendingCancellationRequest
- Received
- RejectedCancellationRequest

## State Model

### Payment Order

The state model for the `domestic-vrps` resource follows the behaviour and definitions for the ISO 20022 PaymentStatusCode code-set.

![Domestic VRP Status](./images/PaymentStatusLifeCycle.png)

The definitions for the status:
|  |Status |Payment Status Description |
|--|------ |-------------------------- |
| 1 |Pending |Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation is pending. Further checks and status update will be performed. |
| 2 |Rejected |Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected. |
| 3 |AcceptedSettlementInProcess |All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution. |
| 4 |AcceptedSettlementCompleted |Settlement on the debtor's account has been completed. |
| 5 |AcceptedWithoutPosting |Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted without being posted to the creditor customerâ€™s account. |
| 6 |AcceptedCreditSettlementCompleted |Settlement on the creditor's account has been completed.|
